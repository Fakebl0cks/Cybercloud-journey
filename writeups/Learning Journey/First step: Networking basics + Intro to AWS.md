# First step: Foundation of Networking, Linux, Cloud, and Security Awareness

## Preface

Since one of my bachelors is on software architecture, I have studied networking basics before, but Cloud/DevOps will be new. So with that in mind, this step will focus on refreshing my networking basics as well as learning the introduction to Cloud/DevOps


## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Grasp the core principles of DevSecOps
- Learn networking fundamentals (OSI, ports, IP, firewalls)
- Become fluent with Linux command line tools
- Launch and secure your first EC2 instance on AWS
- Begin documentation on GitHub & Notion

## DevSecOps

To start delving into DevSecOps, first, I need to understand what DevOps in classical terms implies. The explanation from [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) website is more philosophical, so i'll lean more into the explanation from [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/).

DevOps stands for development and operations. While these don't imply anything, the definition of the term itself is a practice or guidelines (methodology) that increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes.

Now, the development part is self-explanatory, but how does the operations part play a role in DevOps?
While the development part is tied to software engineering, the operations part refers to the infrastructure, deployment, and maintenance side of the application lifecycle. The operations part also includes CI/CD (continuous integration / continuous delivery), which is a core component of DevOps.

DevOps is built upon four basic principles, which are:

1. Automation of the software development lifecycle.
2. Collaboration and communication.
3. Continuous improvement and minimization of waste.
4. Hyperfocus on user needs with short feedback loops.

That being said, how does the security part of DevSecOps come into play?

Taking info from [redhat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops), security has mostly been a final stage process to add to the application development life cycle.
Since DevOps aims to have rapid and frequent development cycles, security must be integrated into the development process as well as security concerns can disrupt the DevOps practices.
The terms shift left and shift right security perfectly explain the mindset in integrating security into DevOps.

> To shift left is to incorporate security testing as soon as possible to find vulnerabilities and fix defects as early as possible in development.

> To shift right is to monitor user behavior, usage, performance, and security metrics in the production stage to verify software operability.

In summary, DevSecOps combines the practice of rapid development, continuous integration and delivery, secure and highly operable software development cycle

## Cybersecurity

The main topics to refresh for cybersecurity are the OSI Model, TCP/IP basics, ports, and firewalls.

The recommended video to watch is [Professor Meyer's Network Fundamentals](https://www.professormesser.com/network-plus/n10-006/network-fundamentals/).
The fundamental of the network is encapsulation and decapsulation. 
Encapsulation: The application data is first wrapped by a TCP header (Transmission Control Protocol), then an IP header (Internet Protocol), followed by the frame header and frame trailer.
Decapsulation is just the reverse of encapsulation.

Sending traffic across a network uses either a baseband network or a broadband network. 

#### Baseband Network

- Generally, a single cable with a digital signal, either copper or fiber.
- Communication signal uses all the bandwidth (either 100% or 0% utilization rate).
- Can be bidirectional, but not at the same time using the same wire or fiber.
- Ethernet standard
  - 100BASE-T, 1000BASE-T
    
#### Broadband Network

- Sending signals over different frequencies.
  - Multiple signals, multiple traffic types.
- Multiple simultaneous communication channels over the frequency spectrum
- Bidirectional communication in which sending uses one frequency and receiving uses another frequency.
- Internet, VOIP are examples.

#### Baud Rate vs Bit Rate

| Feature | Bit Rate | Baud Rate |
|---------|----------|-----------|
|What it measures |Number of bits transmitted per second|Number of signal changes per second|
|Units|bits per second (bps)|baud|
|Relationship|Can be equal to or greater than baud rate|Always less than or equal to bit rate|

Analogy, freight train.
Baud Rate: number of train carriages.
Bit Rate: number of passengers.

#### Wavelength

- A wavelength is the length where the sine wave is repeating.
- Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths
  - A 2.4GHz has a wavelength of 12cm
  - Smaller wavelengths need smaller antennas
- Ethernet over fibers use a very small wavelength (we are talking about hundreds or thousandths of nm)
