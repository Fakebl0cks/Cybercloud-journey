# First step: Foundation of Networking, Linux, Cloud, and Security Awareness

## Preface

Since one of my bachelors is on software architecture, I have studied networking basics before, but Cloud/DevOps will be new. So with that in mind, this step will focus on refreshing my networking basics as well as learning the introduction to Cloud/DevOps


## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Grasp the core principles of DevSecOps
- Learn networking fundamentals (OSI, ports, IP, firewalls)
- Become fluent with Linux command line tools
- Launch and secure your first EC2 instance on AWS
- Begin documentation on GitHub & Notion

## DevSecOps

To start delving into DevSecOps, first, I need to understand what DevOps in classical terms implies. The explanation from [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) website is more philosophical, so i'll lean more into the explanation from [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/).

DevOps stands for development and operations. While these don't imply anything, the definition of the term itself is a practice or guidelines (methodology) that increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes.

Now, the development part is self-explanatory, but how does the operations part play a role in DevOps?
While the development part is tied to software engineering, the operations part refers to the infrastructure, deployment, and maintenance side of the application lifecycle. The operations part also includes CI/CD (continuous integration / continuous delivery), which is a core component of DevOps.

DevOps is built upon four basic principles, which are:

1. Automation of the software development lifecycle.
2. Collaboration and communication.
3. Continuous improvement and minimization of waste.
4. Hyperfocus on user needs with short feedback loops.

That being said, how does the security part of DevSecOps come into play?

Taking info from [redhat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops), security has mostly been a final stage process to add to the application development life cycle.
Since DevOps aims to have rapid and frequent development cycles, security must be integrated into the development process as well as security concerns can disrupt the DevOps practices.
The terms shift left and shift right security perfectly explain the mindset in integrating security into DevOps.

> To shift left is to incorporate security testing as soon as possible to find vulnerabilities and fix defects as early as possible in development.

> To shift right is to monitor user behavior, usage, performance, and security metrics in the production stage to verify software operability.

In summary, DevSecOps combines the practice of rapid development, continuous integration and delivery, secure and highly operable software development cycle
