# 🐞 Bug Bounty Launch Checklist + Beginner-Friendly Platforms

---

## ✅ Bug Bounty Launch Checklist for Beginners

### 🔹 Phase 1: Foundation (Before Hunting)
- [ ] Learn OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, IDOR, etc.)
- [ ] Complete labs on:
  - TryHackMe “OWASP Top 10”
  - PortSwigger Web Security Academy
- [ ] Practice Burp Suite: intercept, modify requests, scan
- [ ] Get comfortable with recon tools: `subfinder`, `httpx`, `amass`, etc.
- [ ] Create a GitHub repo to document findings or labs

---

### 🔹 Phase 2: Ready to Hunt
- [ ] Register on HackerOne, Bugcrowd, and/or Synack
- [ ] Read the program’s scope/rules carefully
- [ ] Start with recon: subdomain enumeration, directory brute-forcing
- [ ] Focus on 1–2 vuln classes at a time (e.g., XSS, IDOR)
- [ ] Try to reproduce known bugs in public reports

---

### 🔹 Phase 3: Reporting & Growth
- [ ] Write clear reports: summary, steps to reproduce, PoC
- [ ] Record failed attempts and lessons in your writeups folder
- [ ] Connect with other hunters via Twitter/Discord
- [ ] Set monthly goals (e.g., 1 valid report/month)
- [ ] Scale: automate recon, try harder bug classes (SSRF, RCE)
